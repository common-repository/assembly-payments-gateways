== Description ==

Accept credit card and bank account payments on your WooCommerce store with [Assembly Payments](https://assemblypayments.com/)


## Why use Assembly Payments for WooCommerce?

- Supports payments made by credit and debit cards issued by VISA, MasterCard and American Express (for US platforms only).

- Detect and prevent payment fraud with CVV/CVC verification.

- Let customers pay directly from your store with our [direct API](https://reference.assemblypayments.com/).


## Requirements

To use the Assembly Payments gateway for WooCommerce, you'll first need to [register for an Assembly account](https://assemblypayments.com/contact/).

== Installation ==

= Automatic Installation =

1. To do an automatic install, log in as an administrator to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the "Plugins" menu and click "Add New".
2. In the search field, search for "Assembly Payments WooCommerce".
3. Once found, you can install the plugin by clicking “Install Now”.


= Manual installation =

1. Download the plugin.
2. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" screen in menu.
4. Use the Settings > Assembly Payments screen to configure the plugin.

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update, you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.
